#1)
sum(is.na(flights$dep_time)) # 8255 flights have a missing dep_time.
#2)
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time)) 
# For the flights that miss dep_time variable, they also miss dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, air_time. 
#3)
# These rows with missing dep_time variable represent that the flights are cancelled.
```

```{r}
#2
flights %>% select(dep_time, sched_dep_time)

flights %>%
  mutate(dep_minutes_since_midnight=(dep_time %/% 100)*60 +(dep_time %% 100),
         sched_minutes_since_midnight=(sched_dep_time %/% 100)*60 +(sched_dep_time %% 100))
```


```{r}
#3
#the number of canceled flights per day
flights %>%
     group_by(month, day) %>% 
     summarize(sum(is.na(dep_delay)))
```

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(month, day) %>% 
  summarize(avr_dep_delay=mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),
            prop_cancel=sum(is.na(dep_delay))/n()) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=avr_dep_delay ,y=prop_cancel)) + geom_point()
# There is a positive relationship between the average dep_delay and the proportion of cancelled flights. In other words, if the average dep_delay in a specific day is large, then there is a high chance that more cancelled flights happen during that day.
